# Prims-Algorithm--MST
This program uses Prim's algorith to determine the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph. 


In graph theory, graphs are comprised of nodes(u), and edges/vertices(v). The weight of an edge is the distance between the
head and tail node of the edge, and in graph theory can be either positive or negative in sign. 

Often, in graphs nodes can be bound to many other nodes, connecting the graph in almost a spider web like fashion. What if we are not
interested in every edge, but in only finding the smallest edges (vertices with least weight) such that every node is connected to another node
with the least amount of vertices and least weight possible? This is referred to as a Minimum Spanning Tree, and has many applications in the
real world. For example, connecting all servers in a network (nodes in the graph) to eachother, spending the least amount of resources possible. 

This program uses Prim's algorithm to take in a weighted graph input by the user, and outputs which nodes connect to eachother
with the weight of the edge between them.
